# Getting Started with Agentic Workflow in Snowflake Notebooks

## Overview

This guide outlines the process for creating agentic workflows in Snowflake Notebook on Container Runtime using [smolagent from Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents). These agents are capable of writing Python code to call tools and orchestrate other agents. In this guide, we will also see how you can create a custom tool in **smolagent** that uses Snowflake Cortex.
